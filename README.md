## Challenges Faced and Solutions

- #### Working with the Data Layer & Data fetching:
  - Challenge: Initially, I was unfamiliar with the TanStack React-Query library for managing server state. Understanding its APIs and patterns was overwhelming at first.
  - Solution: I referred to the React-Query documentation, which provided clear explanations and examples. Gradually, I gained a solid understanding and implemented efficient server-state management using React-Query.
- #### File Attachments in Firebase Storage:
  - Challenge: Integrating file uploads to Firebase Storage required understanding Firebase's Storage API, which I hadn't worked with before.
  - Solution: I referred to the Firebase documentation, focusing on examples of uploading and retrieving files. This step-by-step approach helped me implement a reliable file attachment feature.
